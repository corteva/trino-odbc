### Acknowledgement

- [ ] **I have read and understand the following disclaimer:**

This ODBC driver is tested and supported only in specific configurations on
Windows PCs used within our organization. The primary supported tools are
Microsoft Excel and Power BI Desktop, configured with External Authentication
or Client Credential Auth.

Other tools, environments, and authentication methods are not officially supported
at this time. However, we welcome contributions that extend support to new
frontiers. If you encounter issues outside these supported configurations and
have an intention to contribute an improvement, we welcome your feature request.

If your use case falls outside the supported configurations and you cannot
contribute an improvement at this time, we recommend evaluating commercial,
feature-complete ODBC drivers for Trino for broader compatibility and
cross-platform use.
