### Acknowledgement

- [ ] **I have read and understand the following disclaimer:**

This ODBC driver is tested and supported only in specific configurations on
Windows PCs used within our organization. The primary supported tools are
Microsoft Excel and Power BI Desktop, configured with External Authentication
or Client Credential Auth.

Other tools, environments, and authentication methods are not officially supported.
If you encounter bugs outside these supported configurations, compatibility is
not guaranteed, and these use cases are considered outside the
intended scope of this project.

Helpful bug reports avoid "it doesn't work" reports without details,
as they cannot be addressed effectively. If your use case falls
outside the supported configurations, we recommend evaluating commercial,
feature-complete ODBC drivers for Trino for broader compatibility
and cross-platform use.
